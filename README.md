* [mconfig go sdk](https://github.com/mhchlib/mconfig-go-sdk) 

### Motivation

​	I need a lightweight, easy-to-use and stable distributed configuration center, but I don't want it to affect the performance of my app too much.
​	Although there are many open source configuration centers out there, few have been written in Golang, so I wanted to give it a try.

### Feature

* Writing By Golang
* Lightweight
* Support Namespaces
* Support Limited Gray Publish
* Storage Pluggable
* Stable
